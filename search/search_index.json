TOC is integrated into the left along with each section. Updated docs with Trihorn and Klicky Trihorn. Updated doc links. Renamed a number of files. 23/04/04 Added Trihorn and Klicky Trihorn Began prepping STLs and CAD to move to the E34M1 repo. March 2023 23/03/30 Added CR Touch and CR Touch Volcano entries. Cleaned up some wording in the docs. 23/03/28 Cut down significantly on duplicate documentation. 23/03/27 Added the Tour page. Significant rework of other sections began. 23/03/24 Added several mods. Slightly clarified the compatibility page about PCB mounts. 23/03/23 All PCB mounts: strengthened middle criss-cross for less flex. All PCB mounts: added 1mm clearance between PCB and screws behind. pcb36_mount_cable_chain.stl , pcb42_mount_cable_chain.stl : Moved mount for chain further to the edge. 23/03/20 pcb36_mount_cable_chain.stl , pcb42_mount_cable_chain.stl : New PCB mounts that support 10x11 open cable chain. Lots of documentation edits and updates. 23/03/18 pcb_shroud_30mm_fan.stl : added a new shroud that mounts a 30mm fan for CANBUS users. 23/03/11 top_endstop_mgn12h.stl & top_endstop_mgn12h_pcb.stl : moved modifications from /testing folder. 23/03/10 belt_grabber.stl Smaller to match changes to the front piece. front_universal_fi.stl , front_universal_pis_fi.stl : Narrowed belt loops and inserts for mounting belt catches.

February 2023 23/02/01 bottom_horns_klicky_fi.stl : Modified Klicky horns (still in testing!) 5015_sideways_inlet.stl : Thickened hex grill; it broke off on the build plate. >:( Merged contents of EVA3 branch into main . This should help avoid confusion to newcomers to the repo. Added EVA34M1 on Printables. bl_touch_volcano_mount.stl : New ABL mount for Volcano hotends. January 2023 23/01/26 Deployed new doc site. Updated STEP files. 23/01/24 front_universal_pis_fi.stl : Added FYSETC PIS (portable input shaper) support pcb36_mount.stl , pcb42_mount.stl : Added two files for, e.g., EBB36 and EBB42 stepper-mounted PCBS. These should support all stepper mounted PCBs, not just CANBUS (e.g., BTT Piggyback36). pcb_shroud.stl , pcb_shroud_cat.stl two shrouds to cover up the PCB wiring added (one is whimsical). 23/01/23 Alternate top piece removes the cable support mount entirely now. Started work on rear PCB mount with integrated cable support instead. 23/01/20 bltouch_mount.stl : Strengthened BLTouch bracket. 23/01/19 Fixed missing screw holes in the alternate top piece. Shortened the front intake duct by 1mm. Updated all outdated STEP files. 23/01/18 5015_sidways_inlet_fi.stl : Added some walls for the 5015 fan to sit in and a notch for the bit around the exhaust. Added a Z limit switch mount to raise the limit switch height. Comes with a cover. Added a front intake duct that lets you remove the fan with two screws instead of four. Note: the intake duct is not compatible with 4020 fans (or you lose Y space). 23/01/16 Belt fit test is good. Added a bumper for the X axis limit switch. 23/01/13 Fit test appears ready for testing on a working Merc. Added cutout in belt grabber for divider between belts. Added a version of the cable guide post with the guide to the side. 23/01/12 Tweaked post again for cable guide. Spent most of the day fixing a printer. 23/01/11 Tagged all parts in the Fusion model with part numbers to scrape BOM data. Tweaked BLTouch mount to add a little more material. Added a readme with BOM info. Added a chamfer to the top piece insert holes and an overhang for the endstop mount. Test fitting went well: Found & fixed missing BLTouch holes in the front piece. Made cable guide tower thinner to avoid blocking drive piece. Rotated cable guide around to face completely backwards. Added CAD files for Volcano duct. The duct source file has broken geometry that I am unable to fix. I have made the changes otherwise needed to make the duct compatible. 23/01/10 Started changelog Switched M3 inserts to Mercury One-style to simplify BOM. All parts now use M3x5x4mm inserts. Added Dragon BMO part with resized insert holes. Refactored Fusion 360 files; Split out small Core parts into individual files Removed a lot of quick hacks Added divider to belt grabber between belts. Re-oriented parts to export in the correct orientation for print. Endstop is now EVA-style horizontal and mounted on the right. Ditched rear-mounted endstop design. Still need to design a bumper for the endstop. Cable guide improvements: Rotated guide mount 45 degrees to stay out of the way of endstop. Closer to rear toolhead and takes less X axis space. Raised cable guide 15mm. Rear of cable guide allows for larger zip ties. BLTouch mount: Moved mount points over belt clamp Design a new BLTouch mount Uses a simple cutaway support structure 23/01/07 Started work","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"changelog/#april-2023","text":"","title":"April 2023"},{"location":"changelog/#230426","text":"Assembly: updated belts video to include inserting the belts","title":"23/04/26"},{"location":"changelog/#230425","text":"ABL: moved CR Touch out 1mm.

This tour introduces the E34M1 and everything else you need to print from EVA 3. Core E34M1 Assembly Complete Assembly Icons and Terminology These terms and icons are used throughout the site. The icon is used to emphasize that a part is 3D printed. The shopping cart icon is for example links. There are no affiliate links on this site. Drive: EVA 3 refers to the extruder, stepper, and mount as the Drive module. FHCS: Flat head cap screw, DIN 7991 SHCS: Socket head scap screw, DIN 912 E34M1 Modules Each E34M1 module comes in at least two versions and are specific to E34M1. Front The Front mounts the hotend, belts, and the front of the Drive module. Details and BOM Top The top mounts the MGN12H carriage, the X axis endstop, and the back of the Drive module. Details and BOM Bottom The bottom horns are primarily for part cooling and form the lower joint between the Front and Rear Inlet. Some ABL methods (e.g., Beacon, Klicky) mount here. Details and BOM Rear Inlet Stock EVA 3 has a rear piece here that acts as a belt tensioner. It's unneeded for Mercury One printers, so we moved the cooling inlet forward to save space. Details and BOM ABL Side Mount The side ABL mount is modified from stock EVA. Most ABL methods mount here (e.g., BLTouch and CR Touch). Details and BOM Stock EVA Modules Stock modules have not changed in how they join with other parts. This keeps third party mods compatible while allowing us to make small improvements and fixes to the existing mounting options. We've assembled lists of known hotend and drive mounts. Hotend This mounts the hotend, cooling fan, and optional shroud. EVA 3 Hotends Drive/Extruder The drive module attaches the extruder and extruder stepper to the toolhead.

The first half of the assembly process\u2014building the Core\u2014is universal. The second half\u2014adding the hotend, extruder, and ABL\u2014may differ in details to your assembly. You should have your Mercury One build's X axis extrusion and linear rail assembled before following this guide. It is recommended that you include routing and securing the belts as part of the E34M1 build process. Time Assembly time depends on your experience level and build configuration. Wiring and connecting the belts are not part of this guide, but some guidence is given on these topics. Excluding wiring and belt routing, assembly time is approximately 30 minutes. Print Checklist Before continuing, check that you have all the printed parts necessary.

PCB Shrouds Covers toolhead PCB wiring. Considerations Heat Set Inserts All heat set inserts should be installed before beginning this guide. The Modules & BOM section includes locations for every heat set insert included with E34M1. Warning: Heat Set Inserts Stock EVA 3 uses M3 x 4.6mm OD x 4mm L heat set inserts. E34M1 maintains consistency with ZeroG and uses M3 x 5mm OD x 4mm L inserts (often called \"Voron inserts\"). Double-check which insert you should be using for third-party components to avoid damaging or ruining a printed part. Lock Washers M3 lock washers are used extensively in this guide. Lock washers are not required (and cannot be used for the Drive module) but are strongly recommended to prevent loosening screws.
