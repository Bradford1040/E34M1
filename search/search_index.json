Slightly clarified the compatibility page about PCB mounts. 23/03/23 All PCB mounts: strengthened middle criss-cross for less flex. All PCB mounts: added 1mm clearance between PCB and screws behind. pcb36_mount_cable_chain.stl , pcb42_mount_cable_chain.stl : Moved mount for chain further to the edge. 23/03/20 pcb36_mount_cable_chain.stl , pcb42_mount_cable_chain.stl : New PCB mounts that support 10x11 open cable chain. Lots of documentation edits and updates. 23/03/18 pcb_shroud_30mm_fan.stl : added a new shroud that mounts a 30mm fan for CANBUS users. 23/03/11 top_endstop_mgn12h.stl & top_endstop_mgn12h_pcb.stl : moved modifications from /testing folder. 23/03/10 belt_grabber.stl Smaller to match changes to the front piece. front_universal_fi.stl , front_universal_pis_fi.stl : Narrowed belt loops and inserts for mounting belt catches. The above have been fit tested and aare committed. top_endstop_mgn12h.stl : significantly strengthented the cable guide mount. top_endstop_mgn12h_pcb.stl : cosmetic modifications.

This should help avoid confusion to newcomers to the repo. Added EVA34M1 on Printables. bl_touch_volcano_mount.stl : New ABL mount for Volcano hotends. January 2023 23/01/26 Deployed new doc site. Updated STEP files. 23/01/24 front_universal_pis_fi.stl : Added FYSETC PIS (portable input shaper) support pcb36_mount.stl , pcb42_mount.stl : Added two files for, e.g., EBB36 and EBB42 stepper-mounted PCBS. These should support all stepper mounted PCBs, not just CANBUS (e.g., BTT Piggyback36). pcb_shroud.stl , pcb_shroud_cat.stl two shrouds to cover up the PCB wiring added (one is whimsical). 23/01/23 Alternate top piece removes the cable support mount entirely now. Started work on rear PCB mount with integrated cable support instead. 23/01/20 bltouch_mount.stl : Strengthened BLTouch bracket. 23/01/19 Fixed missing screw holes in the alternate top piece. Shortened the front intake duct by 1mm. Updated all outdated STEP files. 23/01/18 5015_sidways_inlet_fi.stl : Added some walls for the 5015 fan to sit in and a notch for the bit around the exhaust. Added a Z limit switch mount to raise the limit switch height. Comes with a cover. Added a front intake duct that lets you remove the fan with two screws instead of four. Note: the intake duct is not compatible with 4020 fans (or you lose Y space). 23/01/16 Belt fit test is good. Added a bumper for the X axis limit switch. 23/01/13 Fit test appears ready for testing on a working Merc. Added cutout in belt grabber for divider between belts. Added a version of the cable guide post with the guide to the side. 23/01/12 Tweaked post again for cable guide. Spent most of the day fixing a printer. 23/01/11 Tagged all parts in the Fusion model with part numbers to scrape BOM data. Tweaked BLTouch mount to add a little more material. Added a readme with BOM info. Added a chamfer to the top piece insert holes and an overhang for the endstop mount. Test fitting went well: Found & fixed missing BLTouch holes in the front piece. Made cable guide tower thinner to avoid blocking drive piece. Rotated cable guide around to face completely backwards. Added CAD files for Volcano duct. The duct source file has broken geometry that I am unable to fix. I have made the changes otherwise needed to make the duct compatible. 23/01/10 Started changelog Switched M3 inserts to Mercury One-style to simplify BOM. All parts now use M3x5x4mm inserts. Added Dragon BMO part with resized insert holes. Refactored Fusion 360 files; Split out small Core parts into individual files Removed a lot of quick hacks Added divider to belt grabber between belts. Re-oriented parts to export in the correct orientation for print. Endstop is now EVA-style horizontal and mounted on the right. Ditched rear-mounted endstop design. Still need to design a bumper for the endstop. Cable guide improvements: Rotated guide mount 45 degrees to stay out of the way of endstop. Closer to rear toolhead and takes less X axis space.

Note Mercury One.1 with E34M1 has a theoretical build area of 275mm x 275mm using 330mm linear rails.

This tour introduces the E34M1 and everything else you need to print from EVA 3. Core E34M1 Assembly Complete Assembly E34M1 Core Modules These are all components specific to E34M1. Front Numerous parts, including the hotend and belts, attach to the front piece. Bill of Materials Heat Set Inserts Top The top mounts the MGN12H carriage, the X axis endstop, and an optional cable guide. A version is available without the cable guide for toolhead PCB users. Bill of Materials Heat Set Inserts Bottom The bottom horns are primarily for part cooling. Some ABL methods (e.g., Beacon, Klicky) mount here. Bill of Materials Heat Set Inserts Rear Cooling Inlet Stock EVA has a rear piece in this location that acts as a belt tensioner. It is removed in E34M1, with the cooling inlet moved forward and serving in its place. Bill of Materials Heat Set Inserts ABL Mount The side ABL mount is modified from stock EVA. Note Not all ABL methods use the ABL mount (e.g., Klicky, Beacon). Bill of Materials Heat Set Inserts Stock EVA Modules These components have not changed from EVA. As such, you will need to download the correct parts from the EVA site (or elsewhere such as on Printables ). Hotend This mounts the hotend, cooling fan, and optional shroud. Stock EVA 3 Hotends Drive The drive module attaches the extruder and extruder stepper to the toolhead. Note Mounting the Drive (extruder and stepper) assembly normally uses seven (7) M3-0.5 x 8mm SHCS. You will need to substitute three (3) of these screws for M3-0.5 x 12mm SHCS. Stock EVA 3 Drive Modules Shroud All stock shrouds are compatible with E34M1. Stock EVA 3 Shrouds Other E34M1 Components E34M1 provides several other components that may be useful: Component Purpose Front Intake Duct Allows hotend cooling fans to be removed with two (2) screws. X Axis Stop Block Bumper for the X axis endstop, adapted from M1.1. Z Limit Switch Mount Covers the Z endstop PCB. Toolhead PCB Mounts Mounts for '36 and '42 PCBs for NEMA17 steppers.
