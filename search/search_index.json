This tour introduces the E34M1 and everything else you need to print from EVA 3. Core E34M1 Assembly Complete Assembly E34M1 Core Modules These are all specific to E34M1. Front Numerous parts, including the hotend and belts, attach to the front module. Details and BOM Top The top mounts the MGN12H carriage, the X axis endstop, and an optional cable guide. A version is available without the cable guide for toolhead PCB users. Details and BOM Bottom The bottom horns are primarily for part cooling. Some ABL methods (e.g., Beacon, Klicky) mount here. Details and BOM Rear Cooling Inlet Stock EVA has a rear piece in this location that acts as a belt tensioner. It is removed in E34M1, with the cooling inlet moved forward and serving in its place. Details and BOM ABL Mount The side ABL mount is modified from stock EVA. Note Not all ABL methods use the ABL mount (e.g., Klicky, Beacon). See Related and Contributed Mods for user-contributed Klicky and Beacon mounts. Details and BOM Stock EVA Modules These components have not changed from EVA. As such, you will need to download the correct parts from the EVA site or elsewhere (e.g., Printables ). We've assembled a list of known hotend and drive mounts. Hotend This mounts the hotend, cooling fan, and optional shroud. EVA 3 Hotends Drive/Extruder The drive module attaches the extruder and extruder stepper to the toolhead. Note Mounting the Drive (extruder and stepper) assembly uses six (6) or seven (7) M3-0.5 x 8mm SHCS with stock EVA 3. Screws that fasten to the Top module should be substituted with M3-0.5 x 12mm SHCS. This is usually three (3) or four (4) screws. EVA 3 Extruders Shroud All stock shrouds are compatible with E34M1. Stock EVA 3 Shrouds Other E34M1 Components E34M1 provides several other components that may be useful: Component Purpose Front Intake Duct Allows hotend cooling fans to be removed with two (2) screws. X Axis Stop Block Bumper for the X axis endstop, adapted from M1.1. Z Limit Switch Mount Covers the Z endstop PCB. Toolhead PCB Mounts Mounts for '36 and '42 PCBs for NEMA17 steppers. Toolhead PCB Shrouds Shrouds to cover toolhead PCB wiring. Related and Contributed Mods These are user mods that add compatibility or new features to EVA 3.

The first half of the assembly process\u2014building the Core\u2014is universal. The second half\u2014adding the hotend, extruder, and ABL\u2014will have the same general procedure but may differ in details. You should have your Mercury One build's X axis extrusion and linear rail assembled before following this guide. It is recommended that you include routing and securing the belts as part of the E34M1 build process. Time Assembly time depends on your experience level and build configuration. Wiring and connecting the belts are not part of this guide, but some guidence is given on these topics. Excluding wiring and belt routing, assembly time is approximately 30 minutes. Considerations Heat Set Inserts All heat set inserts should be installed before beginning this guide. The Modules & BOM section includes locations for every heat set insert included with E34M1. Warning: Heat Set Inserts Stock EVA 3 uses M3 x 4.6mm OD x 4mm L heat set inserts. E34M1 maintains consistency with ZeroG and uses M3 x 5mm OD x 4mm L inserts (often called \"Voron inserts\"). Double-check which insert you should be using for third-party components to avoid damaging or ruining a printed part. Lock Washers M3 lock washers are used extensively in this guide. Lock washers are not required (and cannot be used for the Drive module) but are strongly recommended to prevent loosening screws.
