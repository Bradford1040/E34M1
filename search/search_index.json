Mecury One Compatibility E34M1 is compatible with Mercury One without limitations, i.e. no print area is lost by converting to EVA 3 from a different toolhead. Minor modifications may be necessary to your Mercury One build (e.g., adjusting the Z end stop height). See Other Changes and Additions for examples. This mod is not yet tested on an Ender 5 Plus or with Hydra. Feedback is welcome if you have tried E34M1 with either. EVA 3 Compatibility Linear Rail/Top Piece Support for MGN12C carriages was dropped in favor of the more common MGN12H that is used with Mercury One. MGN12H MGN12C Hotends Volcano hotends are not currently supported due to the lack of a working Volcano duct. Once a Volcano duct is available, this mod will support all hotends normally supported by EVA 3. Standard hotends Volcano hotends (pending compatible bottom horns) Extruders All stock extruders are compatible. Note Mounting the Drive (extruder and stepper assembly) normally uses seven (7) M3-0.5 x 8mm SHCS. You will need to substitute three (3) of these screws for M3-0.5 x 12mm SHCS. Part Fan Inlets Inlets may be made compatible fairly easily. The inlets included with E34M1 have a lower profile than stock EVA. This allows them to accomodate stepper-mounted breakout boards and should be considered when adapting ducts for E34M1.

The stock ducts contain geometry errors; the ones to the Volcano horns are beyond my ability to repair. Dual horns Volcano horns (planned) ABL/Probes Support for all probes listed are project goals.
