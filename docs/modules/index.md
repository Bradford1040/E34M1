This section of the documentation contains a page for each E34M1 module and the components available for that module. Visit the [Tour](../tour.md) to see how the modules fit together.

Each component contains a bill of materials and visual illustrations of the heat set inserts locations, if applicable.

!!! note
    All heat set inserts for E34M1 parts are "Voron-style" (M3x5x4) instead of the thinner "EVA-style" (M3x4.6x4).
