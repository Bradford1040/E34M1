This section of the documentation contains a page for each E34M1 module and the components available for them. Each component contains a bill of materials and visual illustrations of the heat set inserts locations, if applicable.

Note that this is a reference for native E34M1 components--for example, there are additional, third-party hotend mounts available in the [Hotend Guide](../compat/hotends.md) list than are present here.
