## Additional Mods

### Klicky Docks

These are related mods not linked elsewhere that may be useful for your build.

| Mod Name | Author | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| [Klicky Probe Dock for Mercury 1 Zero G](https://www.printables.com/model/386819-klicky-probe-dock-for-mercury-1-zero-g) | [Sir_Wash](https://www.printables.com/social/415185-sir_wash) | Adds a dock for Klicky; works with `klicky_bottom.stl`. |
| [Ender 5/Mercury One Klicky Probe Dock](https://www.printables.com/model/595738-ender-5mercury-one-klicky-probe-dock) | [jonspaceharper](https://www.printables.com/@jonspaceharper) | Uses M3 instead of M5 screws and provides enough adjustment for regular and UHF hotends. |

### Filament Sensors

Multi-material printing often requires a filament sensor at the toolhead. There are two known third-party mods for this using different detection methods; note that these do not function as runout sensors (they are after the extruder).
