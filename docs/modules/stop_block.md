<div markdown class="jh-grid-para">

**Description**

This is an adaptation of the M1 stop block for EVA 3. It acts as a bumper for the X endstop that can be moved to trigger at the edge of the bed.

Roll in tee nuts may be used instead of drop-in for easier installation.

### Max X Axis Stop Block

<div markdown class="jh-grid-container jh-grid-2">
<div markdown class="jh-grid-para">

**Description**

This block mounts on the top edge of the X joint, triggering at the maximum distance available on the X axis. Use this if you have a large bed or need room outside the bed (such as a nozzle brush).

The M5 x 16mm screw replaces the M5 x 12mm screw that normally attaches the X joint to the X extrusion.
