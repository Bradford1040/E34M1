We're ready to install the hotend. The hotend, fan, thermistor, and heater cartridge are all meant to be removable as once piece, so we assemble them first.
## Parts

| Part | Qty |
|---|---|
| :material-printer-3d-nozzle: [Hotend Module](../compat/hotends.md) | 1 |
| Dragon BMO Hotend | 1 |
| 40mm x 10mm axial fan    | 1 |
| M2.5 x 8mm SHCS   | 4 |
| M3 x 12mm SHCS    | 4 |
| M3 x 6mm SHCS     | 4 |
| *Lock washer, M3* | 4 |

## Steps

!!! note
    Stock EVA hotend mounts come with the M2.5 screw holes blocked by a single layer. Use a screwdriver or other small object to puncture holes for the M2.5 screws.

!!! note "Tip: Fan Direction"
    A fan's airflow direction is usually the side with the manufacturer's sticker on it.

1. Align the hotend's mounting holes with the Hotend module. Hotends with asymmetric heater blocks like the Dragon should have the larger side facing *forward*.
2. Secure the hotend with four (4) M2.5 screws.
3. Install the hotend's heater cartridge and thermistor.
4. Place the 40mm fan on the hotend mount with the airflow directed *towards* the hotend. Rotate the fan so that the wiring trails to the top right edge.
5. Use four (4) M3 x 12mm screws to install the fan. 
6. Use a zip tie to secure the fan, heater cartridge, and thermistor to the zip tie anchor at top right.
7. Place the hotend assembly into the EVA 3 Front.
8. Secure with four (4) M3 x 6mm screws and lock washers.
