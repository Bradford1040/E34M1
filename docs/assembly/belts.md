Now we can secure the belts. Note that if the belts are removed later, the hotend mount must be removed to re-install the belts.

!!! note "Note: Belt Lengths"
    Best practice is to have the same amount of belt under tension for top and bottom belts. To do this:

    1. The belts should be cut to the same length.
    2. The ends of the upper and lower belt should be even on both sides of the toolhead.

## Parts

| Part | Qty |
|---|---|
| :material-printer-3d-nozzle: [Belt Grabber](../modules/front.md) | 2 |
| 6mm GT2 belts     | 2 |
| M3 x 6mm SHCS     | 4 |
| *Lock washer, M3* | *4* |

## Steps

1. Locate the upper right belt catch on the Front module.
2. Take the end of a length of belt and face the ribs away from the X axis extrusion (towards the front of the printer). 
3. Slide 25-50cm (1-2") of the belt end through the *rear* hole for the belt catch.
4. Take the end of belt loop and fold it forward, then slip it out through the *forward* hole for the belt.
5. Draw some extra slack on the belt to keep it from slipping out easily; 10mm or more is plenty.
6. Using the second belt, repeat steps 1-4 with the lower belt catch. Leave *the same amount of excess belt*; the ends should be even.
7. Loop the end of both belts back on themselves so that the teeth face one another.
8. Press a belt grabber over the belts with the toothed side facing the belt.
9. Secure the belt grabber with two (2) M3 x 6mm screws and (optionally) lock washers.
10. Thread the two belts through the CoreXY system of your Mercury One build.
11. Check that each belt is seated on each idler and engages properly with the stepper's pulley.
12. Repeat steps 1-6 with with the left side of the toolhead.
13. Draw firmly and equally on both belts, then push the remaining belt grabber down to keep them from slipping.
14. Keep firm tension on the belt grabber and install the remaining two (2) 6mm screws with lock washers.
