Now we can secure the belts. If you aren't ready to install your belts, you can skip this stage for now.

## Parts

| Part | Qty |
|---|---|
| :material-printer-3d-nozzle: [Belt Grabber](../modules/front.md) | 2 |
| 6mm GT2 belts     | 2 |
| M3 x 6mm screws   | 4 |
| *Lock washer, M3* | *4* |

## Steps

1. Take the end of a length of belt and locate the lower right belt catch.
2. Face the belt ribs facing away from the X axis extrusion (towards the front of the printer). Slide 25-50cm (1-2") of the belt end through the *rear* hole for the belt.
3. Take the end of belt loop and fold it forward, then slip it out through the *forward* hole for the belt.
4. Draw some extra slack on the belt to keep it from slipping out easily.
5. Using the second belt, repeat steps 1-4 with the top belt catch.
6. Secure the belts using a belt grabber and two (2) M3 x 6mm screws with lock washers.
7. Thread the two belts through the CoreXY system of your Mercury One build.
8. Check that each belt is seated on each idler and engages properly with the stepper.
9. Repeat steps 1-4 with the left belts.
10. Draw firmly and equally on both belts, then push the remaining belt grabber down to keep them from slipping.
11. Keep firm tension on the belt grabber and install the remaining two (2) 6mm screws with lock washers.
