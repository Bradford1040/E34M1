The final major remaining piece of assembly is the extruder and stepper motor. If you are using a PCB mount, install the mount before proceeding. The PCB can be added later.

## Parts

The EVA 3 Drive designs do not leave clearance for lock washers. They are left out of this stage of assembly.

| Part | Qty |
|---|---|
| :material-printer-3d-nozzle: [Drive mount](../compat/drives.md) | 1 |
| NEMA17 stepper | 1 |
| BMG extruder   | 1 |
| PTFE tube, approx. 52.5mm | 1 |
| M3 x 35mm SHCS | 3 |
| M3 x 12mm SHCS | 3 |
| M3 x 8mm SHCS  | 4 |

## Steps

1. Set the printed Drive module in place. The hexagonal hole is for the PTFE tube; this can be used to orient the part.
2. Use M3 x 8mm screws to attach the Drive to the Front module.
3. Use M3 x 12mm screws to attach the Drive to the Top module.
4. Insert the PTFE tube through the hexagonal cutout and into the Hotend module. It may be a tight fit; some users recommend rounding the hexagonal cutout with a precision hobby knife.
5. Place the stepper motor and extruder in place. The stepper is normally installed so that the wires connect at the top or to the left.
6. Secure the extruder and stepper with three (3) M3 x 35mm screws.
