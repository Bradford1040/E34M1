This guide covers assembling a basic E34M1 build. Your configuration may be different, but much of this guide will be the same or very similar.

## Time

Assembly time depends on your experience level and build configuration. Wiring and connecting the belts are not part of this guide, but guidence is given on these topics.


## Heat Set Inserts

This guide assumes that all heat set inserts are in place. The [Modules & BOM](../modules/index.md) section includes locations for every heat set insert included with E34M1.

!!! warning "Warning: Know Your Inserts"
    Stock EVA 3 uses M3 x 4.6mm OD x 4mm L heat set inserts. E34M1 maintains consistency with ZeroG and uses M3 x 5mm OD x 4mm L inserts. Double-check which insert you should be using for third-party components to avoid damaging or ruining a printed part.
