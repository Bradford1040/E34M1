With the Top installed, we next build the rest of the Core using the Front, Bottom, and Rear modules.

!!! note "Note: Bottom-mounted ABL"
    - Klicky: install the magnets and wiring to the Bottom beforehand.
    - Beacon: wiring should be done beforehand. If soldering your Beacon wires to the PCB, you will also need to install the Beacon.
