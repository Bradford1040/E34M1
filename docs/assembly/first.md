## Steps

!!! note
    If you printed a right-handed Top, reverse left and right in the directions below.

1. The cable anchor attaches to the rear left of the Top with a lock washer and an M3 x 6mm screw. Orient the two inserts on the anchor to the rear or left side of the Top. 
2. Secure the cable guide to the cable anchor with two (2) M3 x 6mm screws.
3. Align the endstop with the connector oriented upwards. Secure with two (2) M3 x 6mm screws.
4. Set the assembled Top on the X axis MGN12H carriage. The wire cutout and cable anchor should be towards the rear of the printer.
5. Attach the Top with four (4) lock washers and M3 x 8mm screws.
