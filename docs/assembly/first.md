## Steps

!!! note
    If you printed a mirrored Top to home X to the left, the endstop mount and cable guide anchor should be on the left.

1. Align the inserts on the underside of the Top piece with the MGN12H carriage. The endstop mounting holes should be on the right side (*see note above*).
2. Secure with four (4) M3 x 8mm screws and lock washers.
3. Install the limit switch with two (2) M3 x 8mm screws. The switch connector should be pointed upwards.
4. Fasten the cable guide to the anchor arm with two (2) M3 x 6mm screws and lock washers.
